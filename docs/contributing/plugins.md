# Contributing to Gradle Plugins

In this section we focus on [Community Plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html#community_plugins)
which are published on the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/).


## Contributing to Existing Plugins

Many plugins are open source and can be found on GitHub or Gitlab.
you can find source code references on the plugin portal.
For these plugins, you should be able to contribute via pull requests (or merge requests on Gitlab).
Most of those plugins exist outside the `gradle` organization on GitHub.

On the Gradle Plugin portal, each plugin has an _Owner_ which may represent an individual or an organization.
These owners fully define the maintenance and contributing policies,
as well as lifecycle of the components they own.
Hence, the contributing policy may differ.
If specified, it can normally be found in `CONTRIBUTING.md` files in the repository.


## Creating New Plugins

New Gradle plugins are welcome!
If you develop a new integration or functionality for Gradle that might be useful to a wider community,
we encourage you to do it in open source and to publish the plugin on our Plugin Portal.
