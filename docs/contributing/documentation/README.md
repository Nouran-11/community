## Tools

In Gradle we use a diverse set of tooling for documentation development.
We use both Markdown and Asciidoc for writing,
with MkDocs, Jekyll, and the Gradle Asciidoc Plugin as our main tools for documentation.
Additionally, we utilize other tools such as Dokka, Javadoc, and OpenAPI specifications.

Many small patches can be just submitted from the GitHub web editor.
For bigger patches and local development, see the referenced contributing guidelines.

## Private source locations

Please note that some of `gradle.org` locations are private source at the moment.
It includes:

- The main site (gradle.org)
- The official blog (blog.gradle.org)
- The newsletter archive (newsletter.gradle.org)
- Gradle guides and most of the training courses (gradle.org/guides/)

If you want to submit patches to any of those locations,
please reach out to us on the `#docs` channel.
