# Gradle Build Tool - 2024 Software Developer Survey

The Gradle team is committed to enhancing developer experience,
as one of the top priorities on the [Gradle Roadmap](../../roadmap/README.md/).
Your feedback is crucial in helping us prioritize our efforts,
so we've created a survey to help us better understand developers' experiences using Gradle Build Tool.


## Status

!!! note "2024 Developer Survey is Over!"
  
    On November 06, we concluded the 2024 Software Developer Survey.
    Thanks to 500+ Gradle users who shared substantial feedback on Gradle developer experience, key pain points, and Gradleâ€™s future evolution!
    It will take us a few months to fully process the survey results, contact key respondents for interview opportunities, and distribute the swag.

## Take the Survey

For now, a short feedback form is available below for everyone to continue to share their thoughts.  
You can take the survey [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3ZYZ9GB),
and we will make sure to review your feedback and, when possible, include in the 2024 report.

## Swag

We offer a gift card raffle for anonymous responses.
The most active participants, who provide substantial feedback and participate in follow-up interviews with us,
will get special edition Gradle swag.
To participate in the raffle,
submit your feedback by October 31st, 2024.

## Results

Once we collect enough data for processing,
we will publish the initial survey results on this page.
Thanks everyone!
