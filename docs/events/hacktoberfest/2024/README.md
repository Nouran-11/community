[![Slack: Hacktoberfest on the Gradle Community Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Slack-%23hacktoberfest-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=slack)](../../../contributing/community-slack.md)

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of open-source projects, their maintainers and contributors.
Many component maintainers from the Gradle ecosystem, such as the
[Gradle plugin for Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle),
already include their projects in Hacktoberfest.

This year, Gradle is participating in Hacktoberfest!
We are looking forward to collaborating with all contributors on the featured projects, hosting online events for new open-source contributors,
and sending custom Gradle goodies for those who do substantial contributions to the Gradle ecosystem.

## Quick Start

1. Sign-up for Hacktoberfest on [hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com/)
2. Sign-up in [this form for Gradle](https://forms.gle/go2VESj7kDG1QUqV7) so that
  we can contact you and distribute swag
3. Join the `#hacktoberfest` channel on the [Gradle Community Slack](../../../contributing/community-slack.md)
4. Check out the _Featured Projects_ below, or choose something on your own
5. Enjoy, and send some pull requests! :rocket:

Also, consider joining us for [Hacktoberfest events](#events)!
There, we plan to provide some tips on contributing to various aspects of Gradle.

<a name="learn"></a>

### üéì Learn Gradle

If you are just starting out with Gradle,
you can learn through common
Java, Kotlin or Android projects.

* Learn Gradle Build Tool with free courses on [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/catalog). Learn Gradle features, create new repositories while learning, and make sure to mark them with `#hacktoberfest`!
* If you see any issues with the documentation or samples,
  please submit issues or pull requests. They count towards Hacktoberfest.

More advanced users can also experiment with [Declarative Gradle](https://declarative.gradle.org/) and share their feedback.
See the [Getting Started Guide](https://declarative.gradle.org/docs/getting-started/) for the pointers.

To discuss your learning experiences, use the `#docs` channel on the Community Slack.

### ‚úÖ Adopt Gradle Best Practices in your GitHub Actions

We invite everyone to adopt [Gradle & GitHub Actions best practices](https://cookbook.gradle.org/ci/github-actions/).
You can:

* Make them safer by enabling the [Dependency Submission Action](https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/main/dependency-submission/README.md) to [detect vulnerable dependencies with](https://cookbook.gradle.org/ci/github-actions/#detect-vulnerable-dependencies-with-a-dependency-submission-workflow) -
  [How To](https://cookbook.gradle.org/ci/github-actions/#detect-vulnerable-dependencies-with-a-dependency-submission-workflow)
* Adopt the [`setup-gradle` action](https://cookbook.gradle.org/ci/github-actions/) to enable [Build Caching in your builds](https://cookbook.gradle.org/ci/github-actions/#enable-caching-of-downloaded-artifacts)
* Connect them to [Gradle Build Scan](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_scans.html) to get better insights and troubleshooting experience - [How To](https://cookbook.gradle.org/ci/github-actions/#configure-github-actions)
* Update documentation for the Actions, based on your experiences
  ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/gradle/actions), [GRadle Cookbook Pages](https://cookbook.gradle.org/ci/github-actions/))

To tag your patches for Hacktoberfest,
please reference [this ticket](https://github.com/gradle/actions/issues/406)
in the pull requests,
and add the `hacktoberfest` topic.

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Cache Compatibility in Plugins

In the upcoming Gradle 9.0 release, we plan to recommend enabling the [Gradle Configuration Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html) by default.
It will greatly speed up all aspects of Gradle by caching the Gradle work graph created during the configuration phase.
There have been compatibility issues in plugins,
and some are yet to be discovered and fixed.
Hence, we invite contributors to work on updating the plugin ecosystem,
and to test your builds for Configuration Cache compatibility.

  including known issues up for grabs
- [How To: Fixing Configuration Cache issues](https://github.com/gradle/cc-hackathon-2022/blob/main/faq.md#fixing-configuration-cache-issues)
- Discuss: `#configuration-cache` channel on the Community Slack

<a name="cookbook"></a>

### üìñ Expand the Gradle Cookbook

We are working on the [Gradle Cookbook](https://cookbook.gradle.org/) - a new community resource with recipes
for cases that are not included in the main Gradle documentation,
including tool integrations, solutions for specific languages, and tech stacks
(e.g. Android), tips on troubleshooting and plugin development.

You are welcome to create new recipes, or to update the existing ones.
For example, we know that some CI recipes are dated, and contributions are needed!

<a name="gradleup"></a>

### üêò Contribute to GradleUp Plugins

[GradleUp](https://gradleup.com/) is a new GitHub organization focusing on simplifying Java, Kotlin and Android development with Gradle.
The team nominated a few projects for Hacktoberfest: Shadow Plugin, Static Analysis Plugin, Gratatouille, etc. Contributions to other projects are welcome, too!

<a name="community-site"></a>

### üåê Improve the Community Site

We created this community site in early 2024, and there are many improvements to be done!
Improving the look & feel, creating new content, etc...
All patches are welcome!

### üòé Stabilize support for ViteJS

[OpenSavvy](https://opensavvy.dev) is working on bringing the [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) bundler to the Gradle Build Tool, in particular for the Kotlin Multiplatform stack. The initial version works on simple projects, but breaks when used with some configurations or libraries. We're searching for contributors who can help us understand what goes wrong so we can stabilize and release the project.
