# Gradle in Google Summer of Code 2024

Gradle participated in GSoC 2024 under the umbrellas of
the [Kotlin Foundation](https://kotlinfoundation.org/) and the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/).
We started with 3 projects, but two of them didn't pass the midterm evaluation.

- [Gradle Build Server – support for Android projects](./gradle-build-server-android.md) by Tanish Ranjan
