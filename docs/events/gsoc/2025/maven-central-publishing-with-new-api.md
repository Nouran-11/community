# GSoC 2025 - Maven Central publishing plugin for Gradle with new APIs

This project aims to develop a new Gradle plugin compatible with the updated **Maven Central APIs**, simplifying the publishing process through **Kotlin DSL extensions** and automating essential tasks.

The long-term goal of the project is to provide a reliable Maven Central publishing plugin based on the latest Gradle APIs and Kotlin DSL, standardizing and simplifying publishing process across the Gradle ecosystem to help many open-source developers distribute their libraries more easily.

## Team

### Contributor

- [Yongjun Hong](https://github.com/YongGoose)

### Mentors

- [Oleg Nenashev](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev)

## Organization
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

## Technologies
- Java
- Kotlin
- Gradle
- Maven Central
- Kotlin DSL

## Rationale
Maven Central is a key repository for publishing JVM libraries. It is currently [migrating to a new version](https://central.sonatype.org/news/20250326_ossrh_sunset/) with a different API, which existing Gradle plugins donâ€™t fully support yet.

Developing a Gradle plugin compatible with the new Maven Central API will help library authors publish smoothly and adapt easily to the changes.
