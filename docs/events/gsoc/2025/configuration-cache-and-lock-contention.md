# GSoC 2025 - Improving Configuration Cache and Lock Contention in Key Gradle Plugins

This project aims to improve Gradle’s build performance by enhancing **Configuration Cache** support and reducing **lock contention** in widely-used plugins.The project will help analyze cache behavior and identify areas where multiple processes compete for shared resources, which can slow down builds.

The long-term goal is to improve developer productivity and CI reliability by making Gradle builds faster, more predictable, and easier to optimize—especially in large-scale projects.

## Key Goals

This project addresses one of primary causes of slow Gradle builds:

* **Enhance Configuration Cache Support:** Many plugins are not fully compatible with Gradle's Configuration Cache. The goal is to refactor these plugins to ensure they can be fully cached, eliminating repetitive configuration work.


## Project Deliverables

This section outlines the completed work for the midterm and the goals for the final submission.

### Midterm Deliverables (Completed)

* **Code Contribution: Configuration Cache Compatibility**
    * Refactored the `gradle-lint-plugin` to be partially compatible with the Gradle Configuration Cache, addressing deep-rooted reliance on the `Project` object at execution time.
    [Pull Request #433 in `nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin`](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin/pull/433)

  * **Code Contribution: `play-framework-plugin`**
    * Fixed a key Configuration Cache compatibility issue in the Play Framework plugin, enabling more reliable caching for developers using the framework.
     [Pull Request #207 in `gradle/playframework`](https://github.com/gradle/playframework/pull/207)

* **Technical Documentation: A Hands-On Guide**
    * Authored a comprehensive blog post detailing the step-by-step process of making a complex plugin cache-compatible.

### Final Deliverables (Planned)

The second half of the project will focus exclusively on expanding Configuration Cache adoption in the community.

* **Expanded Plugin Refactoring:**
    * I will identify, prioritize, and refactor several more high-impact community plugins to add Configuration Cache compatibility.

 * **Report on Incompatibility Patterns:**
    * I will produce a report covering patterns in Configuration Cache incompatibilities found in the community plugins I surveyed.
     
* **Final Project Summary**
    * I will update all documentation and submit a final report summarizing the project's achievements, challenges, and overall outcomes.
