# GSoC 2025 - Improving Configuration Cache and Lock Contention in Key Gradle Plugins

This project aims to improve Gradle’s build performance by enhancing **Configuration Cache** support and reducing **lock contention** in widely-used plugins.The project will help analyze cache behavior and identify areas where multiple processes compete for shared resources, which can slow down builds.

The long-term goal is to improve developer productivity and CI reliability by making Gradle builds faster, more predictable, and easier to optimize—especially in large-scale projects.

## Rationale

Gradle builds often suffer from long execution times, especially in large or complex projects. The **Configuration Cache** is designed to solve this by avoiding repeated work during configuration, but many plugins are not fully optimized to support it. Similarly, **lock contention** in critical plugins creates bottlenecks that degrade performance during parallel execution.

This project focuses on identifying and addressing these two performance pain points:

- **Improving cache usage insights** 
- **Reducing lock contention** 

By enhancing these mechanisms, the project supports more scalable and efficient builds, benefiting the broader Gradle ecosystem.
