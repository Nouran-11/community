In 2025, [Victoria Chuks Alajemba](https://github.com/alajemba-vik) worked on improving the [IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/tools-intellij-platform-gradle-plugin.html).

## Project abstract

The IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin, the official Gradle plugin for building, testing, verifying, configuring environments, and publishing plugins for IntelliJ IDEs, includes a `VerifyPluginTask` that verifies a plugin against one or multiple IDEs.
Currently, reporting is managed by the Verifier CLI, which employs its custom reporting system to generate verification reports; however, the VerifyPluginTask could benefit from Gradle's Reporting API for more configurable reports.
Additionally, integrating Gradle's Worker API for parallel execution of the `verifyPlugin` task could enhance the IDE plugin development experience.

The goal of this project is to assess the benefits and ultimately implement the necessary changes to the `verifyPlugin` task. Lastly, explore further optimizations to enhance the plugin development workflow.
